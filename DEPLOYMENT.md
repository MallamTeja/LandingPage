# To Clarity Deployment Checklist

## Backend Preparation

- [ ] Install all production dependencies
  ```bash
  npm install --production
  ```

- [ ] Test MongoDB Atlas connection with your production database
  ```bash
  # Update your .env file with the production MONGO_URI first
  node -e "require('./db.js')"
  ```

- [ ] Set environment variables for production
  - `NODE_ENV=production`
  - `MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...` (your Atlas production connection string)
  - `JWT_SECRET=...` (use a strong, unique secret for production)
  - `CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app` (your Vercel URL)

- [ ] Run API tests against production database
  ```bash
  node test.js
  ```

- [ ] Ensure proper error handling throughout the application
  - All controllers should have try/catch blocks
  - Error responses should not expose sensitive information in production

- [ ] Check and configure rate limiting (optional but recommended)
  ```bash
  npm install express-rate-limit
  ```

- [ ] Enable compression for faster response times
  ```bash
  npm install compression
  ```

## Frontend Preparation

- [ ] Update API endpoints to point to production backend
  - Check `connection-check.js`
  - Ensure `API_BASE_URL` is correctly set for production

- [ ] Remove any console.log statements used for debugging
  - Search all files for `console.log` and remove or comment out

- [ ] Set appropriate meta tags for SEO
  - Title, description, viewport, etc.

- [ ] Test loading speed and optimize if necessary
  - Compress images
  - Minify CSS/JS if not handled by build process

- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on various devices
  - Test on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports

- [ ] Validate forms and error handling
  - Test error scenarios (network down, server error)
  - Ensure form validation is working

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Implement CORS properly
  - Set specific allowed origins in production

- [ ] Set secure headers
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - Content-Security-Policy

- [ ] Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS
  - Validate form inputs on server side

- [ ] Use HTTPS for all connections
  - Especially important for form submissions

- [ ] Remove or secure any development-only routes or endpoints

## Deployment Steps

### Backend (Render or Railway)
1. [ ] Push final code to GitHub repository
2. [ ] Set up Render/Railway project and connect to repository
3. [ ] Configure environment variables
4. [ ] Deploy and test endpoint accessibility

### Frontend (Vercel)
1. [ ] Push final code to GitHub repository
2. [ ] Import project to Vercel
3. [ ] Configure build settings if necessary
4. [ ] Deploy and verify connection to backend

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Test complete application flow using production URLs
- [ ] Monitor error logs for the first few hours
- [ ] Set up any additional monitoring/logging services
- [ ] Create database backups schedule if needed

Remember to update your CORS settings and environment variables when you have your actual production URLs.
